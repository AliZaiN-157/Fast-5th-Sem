--Question1:
a. A database is a collection of data that is usually so large that it has to be stored on secondary storage devices such as disks or tapes.
There data can be maintained as a collection of OS files, or stored in A Database System. The advantages of DBMS are:
- Data independence and efficient access
- Reduced application development time
- Data integrity and security
- Data administration
- Concurrent acces and creass recovery.

b. 
1. Security and authorization
2. Data availability and recovery from failures.
3. Database tuning: The DBA is responsible for evolving the database, in particular the conceptual and physical schemas, to ensure adequate
performance as user requirements change.
4. Designing the logical and physical schemas, as well as external schema.

c.
DDL: The data definition language is important in representing information because it
is used to describe external and logical schemas

DML: The data manipulation language is used to access and update data; it is not
important for representing the data. (Of course, the data manipulation language
must be aware of how data is represented, and reflects this in the constructs that
it supports.)

The Buffer Manager: The buffer manager is not very important for representation because it brings
arbitrary disk pages into main memory, independent of any data representation

The Data Model:The data model is fundamental to representing information. The data model
determines what data representation mechanisms are supported by the DBMS.
The data definition language is just the specific set of language constructs available
to describe an actual applicationâ€™s data in terms of the data model
